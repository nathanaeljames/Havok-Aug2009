Havokv3_mscache

a mscache cracker, written by Nathanael Warren, 2009

supports cracking of a single hash, hash and username seed fed in on command line
	hash is a 32-character hex string
	use another program to collect the mscache hashes

the advatage of using the single hash version rather than the multihash version
for recovery of a single hash is that the single hash version may outperform the
multihash version.

cachedump and Cain are good tools for dumping mscache hashes.
