shmoosh takes two wordlist files at once, concatenates (joins)
them and removes duplicate words, producing a tertiary wordlist
for greater efficiency.

shmooshx32 is the 32-bit executable, it can only access 2GB RAM
max before it crashes.

shmooshx64 can access as much RAM as you need, but you need a
64-bit processor controlled by a 64-bit OS to run it.

Thank you to Joseph Moore for 64-bit compilation
